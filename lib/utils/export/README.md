# Simplenote Export

This module provides a couple of functions for exporting all of the notes in the active account.

The output of `exportNote()` is an object containing a map of two arrays: the active notes in an account; the trashed notes in an account.

The notes will be sorted by last modification time with the most recently-modified notes appearing first in the list.

The output from `exportNotes()` can be fed into `noteExportToZip()` to generate a [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip) object containing the information for creating a zip archive of the notes.
This archive contains each note as its own file with a generated filename and the list of associated tags at the end of the content.

## Example export

```json
{
  "activeNotes": [ {
    "id": "some-auto-generated-id",
    "content": "Simplenote is so simple! I love it.",

    "lastModified": "2016-12-22T21:59:36.623Z"
  }, {
    "id": "some-auto-generated-id-that-is-unique",
